# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the app work offline, with ServiceWorkers on Android.

**Thoughts**: ServiceWorkers are awesome! Only they don't work on iOS and that sucks...

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I refactored the info, chrono and contact page, I added some material design elements and finally I started with the redux part I need for the jury page.

**Thoughts**: Funny to see my mind working on the app in the background, giving me new insights while driving.

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I designed the jury page, it maps all the jury entries in Redux store and renders every judge with a picture, a name and a description. I also added a Floating Action Button which navigates back to the homepage.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on my CSS skills...

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a lot about CSS Flexbox. I am trying to style my app with flex on a separate branch, no real improvements yet.

**Thoughts**: It really helps when I share my work and look at the work of others. A buddy of mine showed me flex, because he saw my aweful CSS.

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I implemented Flexbox to the homepage of my app, which means the basics of the app are done, so I started a web perfomance course on Udacity to improve the speed of the app. After that I started with a portfolio for my domain [DitIsAnton](https://ditisanton.nl).

**Thoughts**: I am learning so much more than just CSS and JS during this project!

### Day 6: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a lot about Critical Rendering Path fromn [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud884/lessons/1464158642/concepts/15290985480923) and I refactored the code for my app using stateless components.

**Thoughts**: I don't like it when I can't see the result of my work.
