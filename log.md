# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the app work offline, with ServiceWorkers on Android.

**Thoughts**: ServiceWorkers are awesome! Only they don't work on iOS and that sucks...

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I refactored the info, chrono and contact page, I added some material design elements and finally I started with the redux part I need for the jury page.

**Thoughts**: Funny to see my mind working on the app in the background, giving me new insights while driving.
