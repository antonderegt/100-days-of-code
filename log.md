# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the app work offline, with ServiceWorkers on Android.

**Thoughts**: ServiceWorkers are awesome! Only they don't work on iOS and that sucks...

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I refactored the info, chrono and contact page, I added some material design elements and finally I started with the redux part I need for the jury page.

**Thoughts**: Funny to see my mind working on the app in the background, giving me new insights while driving.

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I designed the jury page, it maps all the jury entries in Redux store and renders every judge with a picture, a name and a description. I also added a Floating Action Button which navigates back to the homepage.

**Thoughts**: I really need to work on my CSS skills...

### Day 4: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a lot about CSS Flexbox. I am trying to style my app with flex on a separate branch, no real improvements yet.

**Thoughts**: It really helps when I share my work and look at the work of others. A buddy of mine showed me flex, because he saw my aweful CSS.

**Link(s) to work**: Here you can see my start on the [Flexbox branch](https://github.com/antonderegt/NAC-Competition/tree/flexbox)

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I implemented Flexbox to the homepage of my app, which means the basics of the app are done, so I started a web perfomance course on Udacity to improve the speed of the app. After that I started with a portfolio for my domain [DitIsAnton](https://ditisanton.nl).

**Thoughts**: I am learning so much more than just CSS and JS during this project!

### Day 6: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a lot about Critical Rendering Path fromn [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud884/lessons/1464158642/concepts/15290985480923) and I refactored the code for my app using stateless components.

**Thoughts**: I don't like it when I can't see the result of my work.

**Link(s) to work**: [The App](https://antonderegt.github.io/nac/)

### Day 7: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Done with refactoring for now. Project size went from 2.4mb to 461kb, 5 times smaller, and so much faster to load! Also got a 100/100 score with [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/). I'm going to continue the Udacity course on web performance though, might make it even faster. This resource helped a lot: [Optimizing React + ES6 + Webpack Production Build](http://moduscreate.com/optimizing-react-es6-webpack-production-build/)

**Thoughts**: It sucks that safari doesn't support ServiceWorkers, such a loss for iPhone users.

**Link(s) to work**: [The App](https://antonderegt.github.io/nac/)

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added a small feature where users can select the team they are on to see the correct timetable

**Thoughts**: React and Redux is quite easy after the steep learning curve.

**Link(s) to work**: [The App](https://antonderegt.github.io/nac/)

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Selected team is stored locally now with IndexedDB.

**Thoughts**: Nice!

**Link(s) to work**: [The App](https://antonderegt.github.io/nac/)

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Found out the app only works in Chrome now, can't figure out why the rest of the browsers stopped showing my app.

**Thoughts**: Bugs without error messages suck!

**Link(s) to work**: [The App](https://antonderegt.github.io/nac/)

### Day 11: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the bug of yesterday, IndexedDb was blocking the DOM in some browsers. I switched to LocalStorage which is easier and seems to do the job just fine, it only has to remember one value.

**Thoughts**: Took me long enough but I am happy I use a versioning system!

**Link(s) to work**: It works again in most browsers: [The App](https://antonderegt.github.io/nac/)

### Day 12: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Checked out Material-UI, a Material Design tool for react.

**Thoughts**: In the next few days I'll keep doing some minor tweaks to the app. Now I have time to work on my portfolio.

### Day 13: January 15, 2017

### *Secret*

### Day 31: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I built Tic Tac Toe up until the multiplayer functionalities. And did a small start on the Simon Game 'cus I got stuck with the Tic Tac Toe AI part.

**Thoughts**: I forgot to update the log for a few days and I wasn't able to program for two days, so that sucks.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good to get lots of hours in again!

### Day 35: February 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished yesterdays work on my portfolio. I implemented the AI in my Tic Tac Toe game, a stupid version but it's a start.

**Thoughts**: My portfolio looks alright now. I had no idea where to start on the AI part of the Tic Tac Toe, I got really stuck, but somehow I got an idea and the first version of AI is running! It just picks an empty spot so nothing smart yet.

### Day 40: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a few FCC challenges and started recipe box react project.

**Thoughts**: It takes a little courage to start a new project, I was tempted to do different smaller task to fill my day. Btw... awesome to have finished the first certificate!

### Day 41: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Great work on the recipe box challenge! First project with react-bootstrap

**Thoughts**: I'm trying out what works best for me regarding how much I should plan before starting to code. Sometimes it's awesome how a project evolves just by starting with basic functionallity and slowly incrementing from there. But today I had to redo a lot of stuff because I didn't have a clear picture of what I was going to build.

**Link(s) to work**: I'll put up a link tomorrow.

### Day 42: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Recipe Box!

**Thoughts**: I think I might like the ReadME of this app even more than the app itself.
